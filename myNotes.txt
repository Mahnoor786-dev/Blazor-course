1. WEB SERVER
signalR establish connection b/w client and server

2. web assembly app

if In web assembly/ client app, you don't see a SIGNALR WEBSOCKET connection: Do this:
Go to network, refresh the application by pressing CTRL+F5
If it doesn't work:
Go to Application, click "clear the site data" button

Goal: several .dll files downloaded by "fetch" type

Why these ddl's downloaded?
bcz everything is processed on client end (in weB ASSEMBLy) so these dll's are required


3. web assembly app with option of asp.net core hosted
make a blazor web assembly app project --> Select > ASP.NET Core hosted

There are 3 projects in this blazor project template

1. webAssembly_coreHosted.Client => Client --> contains components such as index, fetch data etc
2. webAssembly_coreHosted.Server => Server --> controllers or API controllers such as weather forecast controller
3. webAssembly_coreHosted.Shared => Shared --> contains classes which are shared b/w client and controllers such as weather forecast

Note:
 In fetch data we are not getting data from a file but from the API controller inside the server project

HOW WE CAN RUN C# CODE IN WEB BROWSER EXPLANATION:
(Refering to network tab)

-> This project template also downloads dll's bcz client-side processing will be done at the client end

  dotnet.wasm -> this is web assembly based dotnet runtime
-> All these dll are downloaded by blazor.web.assembly.js, this is the script responsible for downloading and 
setting up client app at the client end

NOTE:
	when we refresh the page, see that on network tab, dll's are not downloaded for the 2nd time bcz it already
have been downloaded in the 1st request. when u send request for 1st time, it downloads runtime along wtith  assemblies
And for the subsequent request, it will get it from the client machine


	----------------------------


STRUCTURE OF DEFAULT APP of "BLAZOR WEB ASSEMBLY":

- Execution starts from Program.cs "main" function

- builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
 // application added a root component named as "App" ( <App> ) and this component is aded in 
a div with id "app"

- Where is this div with Id=app located?
-> wwwroot > index.html

- Note: 
 index.html is the 1st page loaded in client browser as a result of requset

- The script linked in index.html i.e "blazor.webassembly.js" is responsble to load:
1.  dotnet runtime
2. application assembly and its dependencies


=> APP COMPONENT:

- Function
1. Install the Router, which is responsible for loading blazor component depending on URL

-Sections:
 1. Found -> executes when route is found
 2. Not found  -> executes when route is not found

By default => Inside MainLayout.razor, file loaded at place of @Body is: Index.razor
bcz this file contains "/". Hence the file that contains "/" in page directive is loaded by default

If you want to make COunter component as default one when app loaded, add "/" to page directive

NOTE:
	If you add "/" in page directive in 2 diff page components, it will cause error

---------------

STRUCTURE OF RAZOR PAGE:

1. Directive => page directive for routing
2. Markup => html
3. Logic => c# code instead of js

Binding b/w c# code and html is done by using @


Q- How c# updates DOM?
see img "how c# updates dom"


-----------------------------------
COMPONENTS:

Pages > add > new item > razor component

Components having page directive are called page Components thats why we save them in page folder

If we want to create a Component without page directive, we have to add it in a separate folder. eg. Controls folder
Q- where will we use them if they have no page directive? They are used as child Component.

When we add child component, it uses the project name with it, such as => <App1.child> </App1.child>
To avoid this project name here, add namespace in _Imports.razor

@using App1.Controls

Now access child Components with its name only
